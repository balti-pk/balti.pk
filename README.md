In addition to its role in everyday communication, Balti plays a central role in religious rituals, ceremonies, and cultural festivals. Traditional Balti music, dance, and literature are often performed and celebrated in the language, reinforcing its cultural significance and vitality.

Challenges and Preservation Efforts:
Despite its rich heritage, Balti faces several challenges to its survival and preservation. Modernization, urbanization, and the influence of dominant languages such as Urdu and English pose threats to the continued use and transmission of Balti, particularly among younger generations.
